When app starts will log you in automatically as anon. THERE IS NO ADDS ON HALF OF MY PROJECT. I had to use flutter web. IOS does not configure on my computer due to hardware issues. THE PROFESSORS CODE DID NOT EVEN WORK.

I think it is complete bullshit to assign a project whree FLUTTER WEB HAS ABSOLUTLY 0 SUPPORT FOR ADMOB so does REGULAR JAVASCRIPT/HTML.

This was an unfair assinment. I am protesting and looking into contacting people higher in the department about this.

Web is in main branch, while 100% working android in master branch.

Web has everything except adds.
